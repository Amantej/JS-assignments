var: These are generally global scope/variables and can be mutable all over the code.
let: These are local or block scope/variables and can be mutable in that particular code of block, where it is intialized.
const: These are constant variables and these are immutable. (blocked scope)
eg:
1.var:
<script>
var a = "alpha";
{
    var a = "beta";
}
console.log(a) //prints beta
</script>
2.let:
<script>
var a = "alpha";
{
    let a = "beta";
    console.log(a) //prints beta
}
console.log(a) //prints alpha
</script>
3.const:
<script>
const a = "alpha";
a = "mikkel"
console.log(a) //throws error
</script>
